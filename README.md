## About the project

NYC yellow taxi trips record data is monthly updated by the NYC government and it is available at the following website: [TLC Trip Record Data - TLC (nyc.gov)](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). This data is a yummy ingredient for every hungry data scientist trying to explore and even building a model.  

## Getting started

Install Conda in order to launch the jupyter notebooks that contains the main tasks of the project. Besides, it is necessary to get basic located-data packages such as Fiona and GDAL in order to work with geopandas library. 

A non-official (but efficient) repository for downloading those packages can be founded here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona 

All the python libraries needed to launch the projects are available at requirements.txt
